## Snake Tournament
Simulating the classic snake game where opponents match up against each and try crash the other into a wall.

As the player moves forward, it leaves a trail behind of blocks (resembling a snake from an arial view). Every time you move to another block, the previous one is filled in, so the snake continually gets longer as you move. The player loses if he has no adjacent blocks to move in to.
